Important information
WARNING
l

Failure to follow the installation instructions included with the display could result in injury
and product damage which may not be covered by the warranty.

l

Do not open or disassemble the display. You risk electrical shock from the high voltage
inside the casing. Opening the casing also voids the warranty.

l

Do not stand (or allow children to stand) on a chair to touch the surface of the display. Rather,
mount the product at the appropriate height.

l

To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, do not expose the display to rain or moisture.

l

If the display requires replacement parts, make sure the service technician uses
replacement parts specified by SMART Technologies or parts with the same characteristics
as the original.

l

Ensure that any cables that cross the floor to the display are properly bundled and marked
to avoid a trip hazard.

l

Do not insert objects inside the cabinet ventilation holes, because they could touch
dangerous voltage points and cause electric shock, fire or product damage which may not
be covered by the warranty.

l

Do not place heavy objects on the power cable. Damage to the cable could cause shock,
fire or product damage which may not be covered by the warranty.

l

Use only extension cords and outlets that can fully accommodate the display’s polarized
plug.

l

Use the power cable provided with the display. If a power cable is not supplied, contact
your supplier. Use only power cables that match the AC voltage of the power outlet and that
comply with your country’s safety standards.

l

If the glass is broken, do not touch the liquid crystal. To prevent injury, handle glass
fragments with care when disposing of them.

l

Do not move or mount the display by connecting rope or wire to its handles. The display is
heavy, and failure of the rope, wire or handle could lead to injury.

l

i

Use only VESA®-approved mounts.

smarttech.com/kb/171167

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

l

Disconnect all of the display’s power cables from the wall outlet and seek assistance from
qualified service personnel if any of the following occur:
o

The power cable or plug is damaged

o

Liquid is spilled into the display

o

Objects fall into the display

o

The display is dropped

o

Structural damage, such as cracking, occurs

o

The display behaves unexpectedly when you follow operating instructions

CAUTION
l

Before you clean the display’s screen, shut down or disconnect the computer. Otherwise,
you may scramble the desktop icons or inadvertently activate applications when you wipe
the screen.

l

Avoid setting up and using the display in an area with excessive levels of dust, humidity, and
smoke.

l

Dust buildup on the camera windows and reflective tape will degrade touch performance.
SMART recommends that you inspect the camera windows and reflective tape for buildup
and clean weekly.

l

Make sure an electrical socket is near the display and remains easily accessible during use.

l

The display should be used only with European TN and TT power distribution systems.
It is not suitable for older, IT-type power distribution systems found in some European
countries. “This system (IT-type) is widely used isolated from earth, in some installations in
France, with impedance to earth, at 230/400V, and in Norway, with voltage limiter, neutral
not distributed, at 230V line-to-line.” (IEC 60950:1999)
Contact qualified personnel if you’re uncertain of the type of power system available where
you’re installing the display.

l

The accessory slot’s maximum available power is 60 W. The slot is not a limited power
source. To reduce the risk of fire, make sure that accessories connecting to the slot satisfy
the fire enclosure requirements of IEC 60950-1.

l

You must connect the USB cable that came with the display to a computer that has a USB
compliant interface and that bears the USB logo. In addition, the USB source computer must
be compliant with CSA/UL/EN 60950 and bear the CE mark and CSA and/or UL Mark(s) for
CSA/UL 60950. This is for operating safety and to avoid damage to the display.

SMART recommends that only trained installers install the display.
This chapter is for installers. Installers should read this information along with the installation
instructions included with the display before they install the display.
WARNING
Improper installation of the display can result in injury and product damage.

Moving the display to the installation site
After your organization receives the display, you need to move it to the place where you plan to
install it.
On occasion, you might also need to move the display to another location after initially installing it.

17

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

IMPORTANT
l

Move the display at your own risk. SMART cannot accept liability for damages or injury that
occur during the display’s transportation.

l

When moving the display, do the following:
o

Follow local safety regulations and standards.

o

Keep the display in its original packaging.

o

Move the display so that its top frame faces up.

o

Have at least two people move the display.

TIP
Display packaging may be labeled to indicate which side is the front. Look for “FRONT” on the
packaging to help orient the box during transportation.

Using transportation aides
You can use the following aides to move the display:
l

Cart

l

Furniture dolly

l

Mechanical lift

NOTE
Larger, heavier models feature eyebolt mounting holes for use
with a mechanical lift. Refer to these models’ installation
instructions for information about using a mechanical lift.

Accommodating doorways, hallways and elevators
In some situations, you might need to remove the display from its packaging to move it through
narrow doorways or hallways or on to an elevator. In these situations, SMART recommends that

18

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

you keep the foam pieces on the bottom corners of the display. These foam pieces protect the
display if you need to set it down during transportation.
You might also need to rotate the display so that its top frame faces to the side. You can do this
during transportation, but when you install the display, it must be in landscape orientation (with the
top frame facing up).

Dealing with cracked, chipped or shattered glass
The display contains safety-tempered glass. Although this glass is heat-strengthened to help
withstand impacts, the glass can crack, chip or shatter if struck with enough force. (Safety glass is
designed to break into small pieces rather than sharp shards if it is broken.) Temperature changes
can cause a minor crack or chip to become worse, possibly causing the glass to shatter. See the
knowledge base article, Shattered glass on an interactive display, for information about conditions
that can cause the display’s glass to shatter even when it’s not in use.
If the display’s glass is cracked or chipped, have it professionally inspected and repaired at a
SMART authorized repair center. If the display’s glass shatters, carefully clean up the area and have
the display repaired or replaced.
CAUTION
For safety and to prevent further damage, do not continue to install or use the display if its glass
is cracked, chipped or shattered.

Saving the original packaging
Save the original packaging to repack the display with as much of the original packaging as
possible in case you need to move the display again after you initially install it. This packaging was
designed to provide the best possible protection against shock and vibration.
CAUTION
Move the display only in the original packaging or replacement packaging purchased from your
authorized SMART reseller. Moving the display without correct packaging can lead to product
damage and voids the warranty.

NOTE
If the original packaging isn’t available, you can purchase the same packaging directly from your
authorized SMART reseller (smarttech.com/where).

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

Installing the display on a wall
Typically, you install the display on a wall in a classroom or meeting space.

Choosing a location
A display is typically installed at the room’s focal point, such as at the front of a classroom or
meeting space.
Selecting an appropriate location for the display is crucial for ensuring the best possible
experience with the product. Consider the following factors as you choose a location:
Factor
Room setup

Considerations
l

The location allows users, including those in wheelchairs, access to the
display.
Refer to local regulations regarding accessibility.

l
l

l
l

l

Power and other
connections

l

The location allows for multiple users to access the display at a time.
The location accommodates room traffic patterns, and there are no
tripping hazards.
The display is not installed where it could be hit by a door or gate.
There are no nearby shelving units, desks or other furniture that has
doors or drawers that could hit the display.
Furniture, wall décor and other room features, such as light switches and
thermostats, do not block the display or are blocked by it. (You might be
able to move some of these room features to accommodate the
display.)
The location is close to the following:
o

A power outlet

o

A network outlet (if you plan to use a wired network connection)

o

A room computer (if you plan to connect a room computer)

o

External audio systems and other devices that you want to connect
to the display

NOTES

l

20

o

If the location is not near a power outlet, consult an electrician for
the power setup you need.

o

Determine if you’ll need additional equipment, such as power
bars, additional cables or cable extenders.

The location is not where the mains power supply enters the building.

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

Factor
Visibility

Considerations
The display’s screen is clearly visible to all users in the room. SMART
recommends users sit within a 178° viewing area:

NOTE
The viewing area depends on the display’s resolution and a variety of
other factors. For more information, see the knowledge base article,
Recommended viewing distances and viewing angles for
SMART Board interactive flat panels.
Lighting

The location is not near bright light sources, such as windows or strong
overhead lighting.
Risks of light Interference include:
o

Reduced visibility: Light sources can cause glare on the display’s
screen, reducing its visibility.

o

Touch system interference: Displays use infrared (IR) light as a key
component of the touch system. Strong light that hits the display’s
screen directly can cause interference with the touch system and
prevent the display from working properly.

TIP
To reduce light interference, install blinds or shades on windows or
skylights and install switches to dim or turn off any lights shining
directly on the display’s screen. Keep in mind that sunlight can come
through windows at different angles at different times of the year.
Acoustics

21

The room has good acoustics (see Configuring your SMART Board 6000
or 6000 Pro for the best audio performance).

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

Factor
Environment and
ventilation

Considerations
l

The location meets the environmental requirements in the display’s
specifications (see More information on page 13).

l

The display isn’t subjected to strong vibrations or dust.

l

Ventilation systems don’t blow air directly on the display.

l

l

There is adequate ventilation or air conditioning around the display so
that heat can flow away from it and the mounting equipment.
SMART recommends at least 2" (5 cm) of space on all sides of the
display for proper airflow.
If you plan to install the display in a recessed area, there is at least 4"
(10 cm) of space between the display and the recessed walls to enable
ventilation and cooling.

Choosing a height
Consider the general height of the user community when you choose the height for the display.

SMART recommends that you mount the display so that its top is 6' 5" (1.9 m) from the floor.
NOTE
If participants will be sitting at a steep angle (such as in a lecture hall), you may have to adjust the
installation height or angle.

Assessing the wall
Be sure the wall you’re installing the display on can support the weight of the display and mounting
equipment. If the wall can’t support the weight of the display and mounting equipment, consider
using a SMART wall stand to transfer some of the weight from the wall to the floor (see
smarttech.com/accessories).

22

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

NOTE
Refer to the display’s specifications for its weight (see More information on page 13).
In some situations, you may need to request an engineering analysis to determine if the wall can
support the display.

Selecting mounting hardware
The mounting hardware required for installation varies according to the type of wall onto which the
display is being mounted.
Refer to the installation instructions for the mounting hardware required for the display.

Selecting a wall mount
It is always best to mount the display on a wall. If the wall can’t support the display’s weight, you
can use additional hardware to transfer some of the weight to the floor.
SMART offers two wall mounts for SMART Board
displays: WM-SBID-501 and WM-SBID-502. Most
displays can use the WM-SBID-501 while the WMSBID-502 is for larger and heavier displays. These
mounts can be purchased separately or as part of a
SMART Wall Stand Kit (WSK-Single or WSK-Dual).
These wall-stand kits are not free-standing mounts;
they still require a wall that can support the
display’s weight.

If you choose a third-party option rather than one of SMART’s mounting options, be sure the wall
mount can support the display’s weight as well as the weight of any attached accessories and can
accommodate the display’s dimensions.

23

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

Mounting the display
Mount the display following the included installation instructions. In addition, consider the
following:
l

Mount the display vertically (90° relative to the floor plus or minus 5° for tolerance) and in
landscape orientation. SMART doesn’t support mounting the display at other angles or in
portrait orientation.

l

Use the SMART wall mount (see SMART wall mount and wall stand on page 12) or a third-party
standard VESA mounting plate.

24

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2

CAUTION
Do not over-tighten the bolts.

NOTE
SMART recommends M8 × 30 mm mounting bolts for standard installations where the total
wall mount bracket and washer thickness is less than 7 mm.
l

Because the receptacles might not be easily accessible after you mount the display, consider
connecting cables for power, computers and other input sources while the display is still in its
packaging (see Chapter 3: Connecting power and devices on page 27).

l

Before turning on the display for the first time, clean the camera windows and reflective tape
following the instructions in Cleaning the camera windows and reflective tape on page 42.

Mounting multiple displays
If you mount multiple displays side by side, install them as shown in the following diagram. This
ensures the displays’ cameras don’t interfere with each other.

25

smarttech.com/kb/171167

CHAPTER 2
INSTALLING THE DISPLAY

Installing the display on a stand
If you want to move the display from place to place or if it’s not possible to install the display on a
wall, you can install it on a stand.

Using SMART mobile stands
SMART mobile stands are designed for SMART interactive displays. They are height-adjustable.
Some models include integrated speakers, a locking cabinet to secure equipment and casters that
swivel and lock for easy movement.
For more information about SMART mobile stands, see smarttech.com/accessories.

Connect the display to power after you install it but before you turn it on for the first time and
configure the iQ appliance. You can also connect cables for room computers, guest laptops or
other input sources as well as for speakers and room control systems.
By installing cables in advance, you make use of connectors that might not be accessible after the
display is wall-mounted. You can then run the cables across floors or behind walls as needed.
WARNING
Ensure that any cables that cross the floor to the display are properly bundled and marked to
avoid a trip hazard.

Connecting power
Connect the supplied power cable from the AC power
inlet on the bottom of the display to a power outlet.

SMART recommends the following varieties of cable:
Cable type

Maximum length

Recommendations

HDMI

23' (7 m)1

Use only certified HDMI cables that have been
tested to support the performance standard you
require.

DisplayPort

23' (7 m)

Use DisplayPort 1.2 compliant or better cables.

USB

16' (5 m)

Use a USB extender if the distance between the
computer and the display is greater than 16' (5 m).
For more information, see USB extenders on
page 13.

Using cables that exceed these maximum lengths may produce unexpected results, degraded
picture quality or degraded USB connectivity.
SMART software should be installed on any computers users connect to the display. For
information on installing SMART software and viewing a connected computer’s input on the
display, see the SMART Board 6000 and 6000 Pro series interactive display user’s guide
(smarttech.com/kb/171166).

Connecting external speakers
The display includes two 10 W speakers, which are designed to provide sound at the front of a
room. You might want to connect the SBA-100 projection audio system (see SBA-100 projection
audio system on page 12) or third-party external active speakers if you’re providing sound in a
larger space.
You can connect external speakers to the display using the stereo
3.5 mm out connector (pictured). Alternatively, you can connect
external speakers directly to a room computer.

1The performance of cables longer than 23' (7 m) is highly dependent on the cable’s quality.

APPENDIX D
REMOTELY MANAGING THE DISPLAY

You can connect an RS-232 cable from the computer’s serial output to the RS-232 input on the
connector panel to remotely select video inputs, turn the display on or off and get information
about the display’s current settings, such as contrast and power state.

IMPORTANT
Use only a standard RS-232 cable. Do not use a null modem cable. Null modem cables typically
have ends of the same type.

NOTE
You can remotely manage only the display and not the iQ appliance.

Configuring the computer’s serial interface
settings
Configure the computer’s serial interface before sending commands to the display.
To configure the computer’s serial interface
1. Turn on the display.
2. Turn on the computer, and then start the serial communications program or terminal emulation
program.
3. Activate local echo.

4. Configure the serial interface settings using the following values, and then press ENTER.
Baud rate

19200

Data length

8

Parity bit

None

Stop bit

1

A command prompt (>) appears on the following line, and the display can now accept
commands from the computer.
NOTE
If no message appears or an error message appears, the serial interface isn’t configured
correctly. Repeat steps 3 and 4.

Power modes
The display has three power modes:
l

On

l

Power Save

l

Standby

All commands are available when the display is on. Some commands are available when the
display is in Standby mode.

Commands and responses
To access display information or to adjust display settings using the room control system, type
commands after the command prompt (>), and then wait for the response from the display.
CORRECT
>get contrast
contrast=55
If you type a command that the room control system doesn’t recognize, you will receive an invalid
command response.

83

smarttech.com/kb/171167

APPENDIX D
REMOTELY MANAGING THE DISPLAY

In the example below, the user included an extra space in the contrast command.
INCORRECT
>set con trast=65
invalid cmd=set con trast=65

NOTES
l

Use ASCII formatted commands.

l

Commands aren’t case-sensitive.

l

Review each entry carefully before you press ENTER.

l

Don’t send another command until you receive the response and the next command
prompt.

To view a list of available commands
Type ? at the command prompt, and then press ENTER.
To identify the current value of a setting
Use the get command.
This example shows how to get the contrast level:
>get contrast
contrast=55

To assign a value to a setting
Use the set command.
This example sets the contrast level to 65:
>set contrast=65
contrast=65
